"""Render singing by running VocalWriter's own synthesiser.

Nothing here models the sound. It builds the memory the engine expects, hands
it notes, and lets the original PowerPC code fill the output buffer, so the
samples are the ones VocalWriter itself would produce.

The engine's shape, recovered from the binary:

  * A sequence is one packed block (see `SetSeqAddr`): a voice key, a count,
    then four parallel u16 arrays -- phoneme, control, spare, duration. Bit 0
    of the control word marks a phoneme that *begins a note*, and the sequence
    must be terminated by one, because `Syllable_Duration` scales a syllable by
    scanning forward to the next note-start and gives up if it never finds one.

  * `Syllable_Duration` rescales the nominal durations to fit the note:
    `scale = (frames << 16) / sum(nominal)`, `dur[i] = max(1, dur[i]*scale >> 16)`,
    padding the first phoneme until the total matches. So the durations only
    matter as ratios, and the phoneme table's milliseconds can go in directly.

  * `e_Fill_Next_Frame` is a state machine on ctx[0x1050]: 1 starts a phoneme,
    2 emits frames, 3 is done. When a syllable ends it sets ctx[0x10ba] and
    waits -- that is the engine asking for the next note, which is what drives
    the loop below.

  * `SayFrame` writes 220 sample pairs per frame, both channels identical, at
    44100 Hz -- the rate VocalWriter's own AIFF exports use. The glottal phase
    increment confirms it: `SayFrame` looks the pitch up in ctx[0xd0c] and
    shifts it by the octave into ctx[0xc64], and reading that as 7.25 fixed
    point against 44100 gives 110.2 Hz for MIDI 45 and 219.3 Hz for MIDI 57,
    within a tenth of a percent of equal temperament.

#: therefore has to span +/-65536, so MIDI's 14-bit bend is passed times 8.
#: Measured: full bend at a 12-semitone range lands on 439.9 Hz from A3, an

#: sets a = voice[0x110]/100 (about 1.03 for most voices). 1.0 is the engine's
#: own value; the knob exists because the application has a Brightness control
#: applied at render time that the MIDI export does not carry.
#:
#: It was briefly set to 0.83, fitted to the long-term average spectrum. That
#: fit was wrong: the long-term average is dominated by consonants, and the
#: consonants and the vowels are wrong in *opposite* directions -- comparing
#: frames that are the same note, time-aligned, the vowels are 10-13 dB *dark*
#: above 4 kHz while the unvoiced frames are ~6 dB bright. One shelf cannot
#: correct both, which is why its optimum looked so shallow. Measured against
#: aligned voiced frames, the engine's own 1.0 wins (8.00 dB rms against 8.85),
#: so no fudge is applied.

#: The voice controls VocalWriter exposes, as

#: its default, so a song that sets none of them sounds exactly as it did
#: before they existed -- which matters, because the values do not round-trip
#: perfectly: colour's default mix is 0.75 and the nearest the 0-127 control
#: can say is 95, or 0.748.
#:
#: Portamento reads a table through ctx[0x1070], which is a pointer the
#: application fills in `Synth_Startup` -- part of its audio startup, not of
#: the synthesis path -- so it used to point at a blank buffer here and the
#: control did nothing. The table is `_g_Time_Tbl`, which `InitSharedTables`
#: does load; see `_voice_controls` for where the two are joined up, and why
#: that happens after the defaults are set rather than before.

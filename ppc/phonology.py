#: on. The tables give every phoneme a manner: 0, 1 and 2 are the vowels, 3 the
#: consonants, 4 the sonorants. Manner alone is not enough in either direction.
#: `y` is manner 0 and is the glide in "yes", not a nucleus; `EL` is manner 4
#: and is the syllabic l of "bicycle", which is one. Their maximum durations
#: separate them cleanly: every vowel in the table allows at least 120 ms, `EL`
#: 160, while `y` stops at 75 and `l`, `r`, `w` and dark `LX` at 100 or less.

#: The syllabic consonants, which are a syllable with no vowel in them: the
#: -le of "little" and the -en of "thousand", "button", "sudden".
#:
#: `EL` needs no help -- it is manner 4 and 160 ms, so the test above already
#: takes it. `EN` is manner 3, which is where the ordinary consonants live,
#: and nothing separates it from them by rule: it is 170 ms, and so are `CH`
#: at 160 and `s` and `SH` at 115, none of which is a syllable. Letting manner
#: 3 through on duration would make a nucleus of all of those and of silence
#: at 305. So it is named instead. Without it "thousand" and "button" came out
#: as one syllable each and would not divide over two notes.

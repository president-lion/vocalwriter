 *    Functionality:
 * 	  This file contains the
 * 	  mainline of the synthesizer task.
 * 	  It reads phonemes from letter to
 * 	  sound, packs them into clauses, and
 * 	  converts them to signal processor
 * 	  control frames.

 *    Revision History:
 *
 * Rev  Who     Date            Description
 * ---  -----   -----------     --------------------------------------------  
 * 001  DGC    	12/27/1984		Renamed from "kl1.c". Many edits for
 *                      		the new synthesizer.
 * 002  DGC   	01/02/1985		Added an "mstofr" routine that watches
 *                      		out for overflow on 16 bit machines.
 * 003  DGC		01/19/1985    	Dennis changed "phdefs.h" so that it always
 *                      		included "def.h". Deleted the include line
 *                      		that was in this file.
 * 004  DGC		01/24/1985    	Added some code at the top of the main
 *                      		loop that turns WBOUND into COMMA if it
 *                      		looks like we are getting close to the edge.
 * 005  DGC		01/31/1985    	Changed the way that "SYNC" is done.
 * 006  DGC		03/06/1985    	Changed the code that writes out the index
 *                      		reply stuff to use "PUTSEQ".
 * 007  DGC		04/17/1985    	Changes due to default/0 change in "ansi.c".
 * 008  DGC 	06/02/1985   	Added LOG_PHONEME.
 * 009  DGC		06/07/1985    	"ef" => "lx" in speaker definition.
 * 010  DGC 	06/18/1985   	"g5" => "lo" in speaker definition.
 * 011  DGC 	06/19/1985	    Enforce limits for ":ra", ":cp", ":pp".
 * 012  DGC		07/26/1985	    "outpar" isn't  structure anymore.
 * 013  DGC		08/08/1985	    "haltsw" (FLAG) => "halting" (short), new sync.
 *    							Released as C5005 V1.0 firmware.
 * 014  DGC 	10/21/1985   	Changes for KRM.
 * 015  DGC 	11/07/1985	    Fixed a bug in indexing found by Kurzweil.
 * 016  EAB 	01/12/1990  	Put in changes for NKR and SENT.(compile changes)
 * 017  EAB 	01/16/1990  	change rate limit from 350 to 550

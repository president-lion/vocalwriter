"""VocalWriter Studio -- build a line of singing, note by note.

    python -m app.studio

A note carries a *group* of phonemes and one pitch, because that is how singing
works: a syllable sits on a note, not one phoneme per note. "Add word" looks the
word up in VocalWriter's own dictionary and puts its phonemes on a single note,
which can then be edited, split or removed.

Everything is reachable from the keyboard and reads with a screen reader. The
list is a native control, editing happens in dialogs with ordinary labelled
fields rather than inside the list, and every action has a shortcut. Enter on a
row edits it, Delete removes it, and both a whole note and a single phoneme can
be heard on their own before committing to them.

Rendering costs several times the length of the audio, so the interface is
built to avoid it: previewing one note renders only that note, and repeating a
render that has already been done returns the cached audio at once.

"""The engine, in this process, answering on a worker thread.

There used to be a second process here, spoken to in JSON lines. That was not
architecture for its own sake: a render under the PowerPC interpreter ran tens
of millions of guest instructions and took roughly as long as the music lasts,
and nothing that slow can happen on the thread that draws the window. The C
engine renders a minute of singing in a few hundredths of a second, so the
process boundary bought nothing and cost a serialisation of every request.

The thread stays. A render is fast, not instant -- a long song is still a
fraction of a second, and a fraction of a second of a frozen window is the
difference between an interface that answers and one that stutters. Requests
go on a queue, they are answered in the order they were asked, and the answer
arrives in a callback; whoever asked hands it back to the window with
`wx.CallAfter`, as it always did.

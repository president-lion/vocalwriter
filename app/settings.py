"""Settings that belong to the program rather than to a song.

A song carries its own tempo, its reverb and the rest, and those travel with
the file. What is here is how you like to work -- and that follows you from
song to song, so it lives in one small JSON file beside the operating system's
other per-user settings.

Nothing here changes a note or a sample. If the file is missing, unreadable,
or full of nonsense, the defaults stand and the program says nothing about it:
a preference is not worth an error message.
